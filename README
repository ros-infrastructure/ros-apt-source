README for the ros-keyring package
=====================================

Introduction
------------

The ROS project signs its Release files that are stored on the
ROS server and its mirrors. 


Keys and keyrings
-----------------
The keyrings/ directory hosts two kind of .gpg files:

 * ros-key-*: gpg individual keys
    - Extracted from keyrings using "./debian/rules regenerate-key-fragments"
    - Fingerprint in d/rules
    - Installed in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/

 * ros-*-keyrings.gpg: group of keys
    - Installed in /usr/share/keyrings/

The ubuntu-keyring repository design assumes that new keys are first added
to keyrings files ahd from there current individual keys supported are extracted
to this repository using:

    - "./debian/rules regenerate-key-fragments"


SHA512SUM signature
-------------------

The SHA512SUM file stores the hashes for the key and keyring gpg files
signed by the person that updates these gpg keys.

The ubuntu-keyring official package uses the Debian keyring file in
/usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg to check the signature of
the SHA512SUM file assuming that anyone updating this package
will have his/her key in the debian keyring.

TODO: for the ROS case the web of trust needs to be stablished in a
different way.
